# Stockwatch

I made _Stock Watch_ because I felt like there weren't
any good lightweight applications for analyzing stocks. I
found that the apps which let me conduct the analysis I
wanted were either too expensive or had way too many
features I would never use. My future goal with
Stock Watch is to provide a suite of useful analysis
tools in an intuitive UI at a reasonable price.

My main focus for this app right now is providing tools for
conducting fundamental analysis. I want to figure out a way
to pull company SEC filings and export data into
standardized excel templates for analysis. I've spent
countless hours copying and pasting financial information
from company filings into an excel spreadsheet before even
being able to begin any analysis, and this is a major area
where I think this app can provide value to people. A lot of
this app is still being planned / in progress, and this will
definitely be a project I leave alone for months at a time,
and then find motivation to come back to it and build out a
new feature.
